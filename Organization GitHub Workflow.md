**Organization GitHub Workflow (Detailed Flowchart with Commands, Comments & Sample Project)**

## **Flowchart Steps:**

1. **Start**
   - A developer picks a task from the backlog or is assigned work.

2. **Initialize Repository (If not already cloned)**
   - Clone the organization repository → `git clone <org-repo-url>`
   - Navigate to the repo → `cd <repo-name>`
   - Check the active remote repository → `git remote -v`

3. **Create a New Feature/Task Branch**
   - `git checkout -b feature/task-branch` (Creates and switches to a new branch)
   - View all branches → `git branch -a`
   - Switch between branches → `git checkout <branch-name>`
   - Fetch the latest changes from remote → `git fetch origin`
   - Rebase with the latest `develop` or `main` branch → `git rebase origin/main`

4. **Make Changes**
   - Modify or add new code/files.
   - Check the current status using `git status`.
   - View changes before committing → `git diff`

5. **Stage and Commit Changes**
   - Stage all changes → `git add .`
   - Stage specific files → `git add <file>`
   - Commit changes with a meaningful message → `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
   - Amend last commit (if needed) → `git commit --amend`

6. **Push Changes to GitHub**
   - If pushing a new branch: `git push -u origin feature/task-branch`
   - If updating an existing branch: `git push origin feature/task-branch`
   - View remote branches → `git branch -r`
   - Resolve conflicts if necessary → `git merge main` or `git rebase main`

7. **Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub**
   - Compare changes with `main` or `develop`.
   - Assign reviewers for code review.
   - Request review from specific team members.
   - Add comments on PR if necessary.

8. **Code Review Process**
   - If PR is approved → Proceed to merge.
   - If changes are requested → Modify, commit, and push again.
   - If necessary, abandon or close PR.
   - Sync with the latest changes before merging → `git pull --rebase origin main`

9. **Merge PR into Main/Develop Branch**
   - Via GitHub UI or `git merge feature/task-branch`.
   - Delete feature branch locally (`git branch -d feature/task-branch`).
   - Delete remote branch → `git push origin --delete feature/task-branch`
   - Sync local `main` or `develop` branch → `git pull origin main`

10. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution**
    - Automated testing and build processes run via CI/CD pipelines.
    - If build/tests fail → Fix and push again.
    - If successful → Deploy changes.

11. **Deploy & Monitor**
    - Deploy changes to staging/production.
    - Monitor application performance and fix any arising issues.
    - Rollback if necessary → `git revert <commit-hash>` or `git reset --hard <commit-hash>`

12. **End**
    - Workflow resets for new features or updates.

### **Sample Project Example:**
**Project:** `E-Commerce Web App`
- **Repository Name:** `ecommerce-platform`
- **Feature Branch:** `feature-checkout-redesign`
- **Main Branch:** `main`
- **Development Branch:** `develop`

**Example Commands for Workflow:**
```sh
# Clone the organization repository
$ git clone https://github.com/org-name/ecommerce-platform.git
$ cd ecommerce-platform

# Create a new feature branch
$ git checkout -b feature-checkout-redesign

# Make changes and stage them
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Redesigned checkout process"

# Push changes and open PR
$ git push -u origin feature-checkout-redesign
```
